# Working-With-Tables

HTML tables are sometimes misused as a styling technique, but they are designed for the display of tabular data.

This project will require the use of well structured, semantic HTML & CSS to create a project similar to [this](https://dean-schedule.netlify.com).

You are free to give the project your own style, or utilize the resources provided. Challenge yourself to change the design as much as you would like and select a sporting team of your choice or utilize the resources provided [here](http://link) 

Be sure you have met the requirements of each of the user stories. Push your completed project to GitHub and submit a pull request to the Master Branch when you are ready to submit.

## Project Outline

For this project, you will create a landing page displaying the current season's schedule for your favorite sports team. You will code this page using VSCode or your text editor of choice. 

Typically, when developers are given a comp, there is little room for modification. In this case, I would like for you to be creative with this project.

I have provided several examples of what your completed project could look like. 

### User Stories
1. I have utilized at least (3)images - ensuring accessibility
2. I have properly utilized a table to display tabular data
    + Must include at least 8 rows of data
3. Color Scheme and design should be easy to follow and consistent throughout 
    + You may want to utilize a color picker to ensure the correct Hex codes.
    
## Getting Started

1. **Create A Plan**

Contrary to popular belief, developers don't just jump in and begin coding. Wether or not developers have been provided a working comp, its important to plan both the visul layout of the page and code's structure.

Make design decisions about how the final project will look and behave FIRST!

2. In your bash terminal, use the necessary commands to clone this repo to your local *projects* directory

3. Gather any image assets you plan to use to complete the project. You may use any of the resources [here](http://newlinkhere.com) by downloading the resources and adding them to the project's images directory. Alternatively, you may utilize your own resources.
    + Remember to compress your image assets

3. Start Coding!


### Tips

+ Plan ahead
+ Layout the structure before working on the presentation
+ Commit Often - Once you have a chunk of your page working as you would like, it may be a good stopping point to make a commit. 
    + Remember you can make as many commits are you need to even before pushing to GitHub.
